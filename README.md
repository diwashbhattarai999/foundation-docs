â”œâ”€â”€ content/docs/        # MDX-based documentation files
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                # Fumadocs route handlers and layout logic

## Writing Docs

All documentation is written using **MDX** with support for components like:

- `<Cards>` and `<Card>`
- `<Tabs>`, `<Callout>`, etc.
- Auto-generated ToC and navigation

Each page requires frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: Git Basics
description: Learn how Git works internally
---
```

---

## ðŸ›  Customization

- Update `DocsLayout`, `HomeLayout`, and `meta()` functions to match your branding
- Use `source.pageTree` in `source.ts` to manually control sidebar structure
