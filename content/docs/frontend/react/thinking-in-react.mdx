title: Thinking in React
description: Thinking in React is a mindset that helps you build UIs by breaking them into components, managing state effectively, and ensuring unidirectional data flow. This guide walks you through the 5-step process to master this approach.

## Why Is "Thinking in React" Important?

React encourages **component-driven development** and **unidirectional data flow**.
You should **build your UI by breaking it into components**, structuring your data, and handling interactions thoughtfully.

---

## The 5-Step Process to Think in React

---

### **Step 1: Break the UI into a Component Hierarchy**

1. **Draw or inspect your UI** — visually identify reusable pieces.
2. Identify components and their **parent-child relationships**.
3. Each component should ideally do **one thing well** (Single Responsibility Principle).

**Example: Product List**

```plaintext
App
 └── ProductTable
     ├── SearchBar
     └── ProductList
         └── ProductRow
```

Use [Separation of Concerns](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html#step-1-break-the-ui-into-a-component-hierarchy) based on UI responsibility, not file size or lines of code.

---

### **Step 2: Build a Static Version in React**

- Don’t add interactivity yet.
- Use **props to pass data down**.
- Build **dumb components** that render UI using static data.

Use `useState` or other hooks **later** — only when needed.

---

### **Step 3: Identify the Minimal Representation of UI State**

- Think: **What changes over time?**
- For example:

  - Search text
  - Checked boxes
  - User inputs

- Avoid duplicating state:

  - Derive anything you can from props/state instead of storing it separately.

> The most important principle for structuring state is to keep it DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).

---

### **Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live**

The right place for your state is:

1. The component **that owns all the data**.
2. Or the **closest common ancestor** of components that need it.

You may need to **lift state up** to the parent, or **move it down** as props.

---

### **Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow (Callbacks)**

- Now handle user interactions.
- Use **callbacks** (e.g., `onChange`, `onClick`) passed via props.
- These trigger `setState` in the parent, and **re-render flows down**.

> This is how you implement controlled components, filtering lists, toggling flags, etc.

## Best Practices When Thinking in React

1. **Design from top-down or feature-based**
2. Keep components **small and single-responsibility**
3. Prefer **props over state** when possible
4. Share state via **lifting or global store** (if needed)
5. Think in **data flow** — top-down
