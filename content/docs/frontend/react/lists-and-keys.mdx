## **Rendering Lists in React**

React makes it easy to render lists using `Array.map()`. This is how you typically render a list of items dynamically:

```tsx
const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];

export function FruitList() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {fruits.map((fruit, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{fruit}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## **Why Use `key` Prop in Lists?**

### A `key` is a special string attribute you **must** include when creating lists of elements.

**React uses `key` to:**

- Identify which items changed, were added, or removed.
- Optimize re-renders by efficiently reconciling DOM changes.

---

### Without a Key – What Happens?

React has no reliable way to identify list items. This may lead to:

- Reordering bugs
- Input losing focus
- Unnecessary DOM re-renders

---

## Avoid Using Index as Key (When to Use & Not Use Index)

### Okay to use index:

- The list is **static** and never changes.
- Items don’t have a unique ID or state.
- Performance isn’t critical.

```tsx
items.map((item, index) => <li key={index}>{item}</li>);
```

### Avoid using index when:

- List items can **change order**.
- Items can be **added/removed** dynamically.
- The item has **local state** (like form inputs).

**Bad Example:**

```tsx
const todos = [{ task: "Learn" }, { task: "Build" }];

todos.map((todo, index) => <input key={index} defaultValue={todo.task} />);
```

If one item is removed from the middle, React might keep the wrong input state for the remaining ones.

---

## Best Practice: Use Unique & Stable IDs as Keys

```tsx
const users = [
  { id: 101, name: "Alice" },
  { id: 102, name: "Bob" },
];

users.map((user) => <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>);
```

- Ensures React can properly track changes even if list is modified.

---

## Lists of Components

You can also render lists of **custom components**:

```tsx
function TodoItem({ task }: { task: string }) {
  return <li>{task}</li>;
}

export function TodoList() {
  const tasks = ["Write", "Refactor", "Test"];
  return (
    <ul>
      {tasks.map((task) => (
        <TodoItem key={task} task={task} />
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

---

## Keys Don’t Get Passed as Props

- Keys are only used **internally by React**.
- They are **not accessible** inside child components.

If you need an ID inside the component, you must pass it explicitly:

```tsx
<TodoItem key={task.id} id={task.id} task={task.task} />
```

## Summary

| Concept        | Controlled With Key? | Why It Matters? |
| -------------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| Performance    | ✅ Yes               | Faster updates  |
| Predictability | ✅ Yes               | Avoid bugs      |
| Correctness    | ✅ Yes               | Proper DOM sync |
| Index as Key   | ❌ Not ideal         | Leads to bugs   |

## Quick Takeaways

- Always use a `key` when rendering lists.
- Prefer unique, **stable identifiers** over index.
- Never rely on index if the list is dynamic.
- Keys are used internally by React — not passed to components.
