description: Learn how to use React's Suspense to handle lazy loading of components and data fetching, improving user experience with fallback UIs.
---

## What is `React.Suspense`?

**`Suspense`** is a built-in React component that allows you to **pause rendering** while waiting for something (like a lazy component or data) and **show a fallback UI** in the meantime.

```tsx
<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  <LazyComponent />
</Suspense>
```

---

## Why `Suspense`?

React’s default behavior is **synchronous rendering** — but what if a component takes time to load (e.g., network fetch, lazy-loaded component)? You don’t want to block the whole app — that’s where `Suspense` comes in.

---

## Primary Use Cases

1. **Lazy loading components** (with `React.lazy()`)
2. **Concurrent UI rendering** (React 18+)
3. **Data fetching** (via third-party libs like `React Query`, Relay, or `@tanstack/react-query`)

---

## How Suspense Works (Conceptually)

- When React encounters a `Suspense` boundary and the child is **not yet ready**, it **pauses rendering** of that subtree.
- React then renders the `fallback`.
- When the child is ready, React continues rendering it **without re-rendering the entire tree**.

---

## Basic Syntax

```tsx
import { lazy, Suspense } from "react";

const Dashboard = lazy(() => import("./Dashboard"));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <Dashboard />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

> The `fallback` prop is **required** — it's what shows during loading.

---

## Requirements

- You **must** use `React.lazy()` with `Suspense`. No other way to lazy load components natively.
- `React.lazy()` **only supports default exports**.
- Works **only in the client**, not directly with SSR (you need extra libraries like `loadable-components` for SSR).

---

## Nested Suspense

You can nest `Suspense` components to control loading boundaries better:

```tsx
<Suspense fallback={<p>Loading layout...</p>}>
  <Layout>
    <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading dashboard...</p>}>
      <Dashboard />
    </Suspense>
  </Layout>
</Suspense>
```

---

## Real World Example – Code Splitting

```tsx
const Home = lazy(() => import("./pages/Home"));
const About = lazy(() => import("./pages/About"));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

---

## `Suspense` for Data Fetching (React 18+)

React 18 brings **Concurrent Features**, and you can use `Suspense` to pause rendering while **data loads**.

However, it **requires** a data fetching library that integrates with Suspense, such as:

- [`React Relay`](https://relay.dev/)
- [`@tanstack/react-query`](https://tanstack.com/query/v5)
- [`SWR`](https://swr.vercel.app/) (experimental support)

```tsx
<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  <Profile />
</Suspense>
```

In this case, the `Profile` component will **throw a Promise** internally (using a custom hook) and Suspense will **catch it** and show the fallback until it's resolved.

---

## Suspense with `useTransition` (Concurrent Rendering)

React 18 also introduced `useTransition`:

```tsx
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

startTransition(() => {
  setTab("profile");
});
```

Here, `Suspense` can be used with transitions to avoid jank during slow UI updates.

## Tooling Notes

| Feature                   | Supported           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Client-side lazy loading  | ✅ Built-in         |
| Data fetching             | ⚠️ Needs library    |
| SSR support               | ❌ Needs extra libs |
| Works with `React.lazy()` | ✅ Yes              |
| Fallback control          | ✅ Yes              |

---

## Best Practices

1. **Use Suspense for route-level boundaries.**
2. Nest Suspense for **fine-grained control** (e.g., image gallery, dashboard widgets).
3. Use meaningful fallback UIs — not just "Loading…"
4. Combine with **lazy-loaded components and code splitting**.
5. For data fetching, use **React Query, Relay, or SWR** with `Suspense`.

## Summary

| Concept    | Description                                                                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Suspense` | A component that pauses rendering and shows fallback until children are ready |
| Works with | `React.lazy()` and some data-fetching libs                                    |
| Fallback   | A required prop for showing UI while loading                                  |
| Benefits   | Smoother UX, less jank, faster initial load                                   |
| React 18   | Enables concurrent rendering and data streaming                               |
