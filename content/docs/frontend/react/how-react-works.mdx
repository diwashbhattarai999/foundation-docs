# How React Works Internally (with Virtual DOM)

---

## 1. React is a Declarative UI Library

Instead of **manually updating the DOM**, in React you **describe** what the UI should look like.

React takes care of:

- Efficient DOM updates
- UI consistency
- Performance optimization

```tsx
// You tell React:
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>
// React figures out: how to update the DOM to match this new state
```

---

## 2. What is the Virtual DOM?

### Definition

The **Virtual DOM (VDOM)** is a **lightweight JavaScript object** that represents the actual DOM.

> React uses the VDOM as an in-memory tree to track changes efficiently.

---

### Why Not Update the Real DOM Directly?

- DOM operations are **slow**
- Manual updates are **error-prone**
- Performance degrades as app complexity grows

React avoids this by:

1. Creating a **VDOM**
2. Re-rendering VDOM on state/prop change
3. **Diffing** the new VDOM with the old one
4. Updating **only** the changed part in the real DOM

---

## 3. Reconciliation & Diffing

### What happens when `setState()` is called?

1. React **re-renders** the component to produce a **new VDOM**
2. React **compares (diffs)** the new VDOM with the previous one
3. React **calculates the minimal number of changes**
4. React **patches** the actual DOM

> This process is called **Reconciliation**

---

### Efficient Diffing: Key Rules

- React compares **type and key** of elements
- React reuses DOM nodes if type is same
- Use `key` in lists to help React track changes

```tsx
<ul>
  {items.map((item) => (
    <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

## 4. How React Updates the DOM Efficiently

| Step               | Description                                                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Initial Render     | JSX is converted to Virtual DOM                                        |
| State/Prop Change  | New Virtual DOM tree is generated                                      |
| Diffing            | React compares new tree with old tree                                  |
| Minimal DOM Update | Only the parts that changed are updated in the actual DOM              |
| Batch Updates      | React batches multiple updates in a single render cycle for efficiency |

---

## 5. Component Lifecycle (Functional)

> In **functional components**, lifecycle is handled using **hooks**

| Lifecycle Phase | Hook Used                            | Use Case                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Mount           | `useEffect(() => {}, [])`            | API calls, event subscriptions |
| Update          | `useEffect(() => {}, [value])`       | Reacts to value/state changes  |
| Unmount         | `return () => {}` inside `useEffect` | Cleanup (e.g., clear timers)   |

---

### Example: Functional Lifecycle

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Mounted");

  return () => {
    console.log("Unmounted");
  };
}, []);
```

---

## 6. JSX → React.createElement()

> JSX is not HTML. It is **syntactic sugar** for `React.createElement`.

```tsx
// JSX
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>;

// Compiled
React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, world!");
```

You need a build tool (like Vite, Webpack, or Next.js) to transform JSX into valid JS.

---

## 7. What Triggers a Re-render in React?

| Trigger                  | Causes re-render?   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| `useState` set           | ✅ Yes              |
| `props` change           | ✅ Yes              |
| `context` value change   | ✅ Yes              |
| `useEffect` trigger      | ✅ Yes (indirectly) |
| External variable change | ❌ No               |

---

## 8. React Fiber Architecture (Advanced)

React uses **Fiber**: a reimplementation of the React core algorithm.

### Fiber's Advantages:

- **Interruptible rendering** (concurrent mode)
- **Prioritized updates**
- Enables features like **Suspense**, **Transitions**, and **Concurrent Rendering**

> Fiber allows React to **pause and resume** work, making it faster and more responsive.

---

## 9. Best Practices to Keep React Efficient

| Practice                         | Why?                             |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Use keys in lists                | Helps diffing                    |
| Use `React.memo`                 | Avoids unnecessary re-renders    |
| Extract logic into hooks         | Keeps components clean           |
| Avoid anonymous functions inline | Reduces re-creation of functions |
| Keep state local where possible  | Reduces global re-renders        |

## Summary

- React builds UI using **declarative** component trees
- Uses **Virtual DOM** to compare and apply efficient DOM updates
- Re-renders are **triggered by state, props, or context**
- Lifecycle and side effects handled via `useEffect`
- Fiber enables **concurrent rendering and advanced performance features**
