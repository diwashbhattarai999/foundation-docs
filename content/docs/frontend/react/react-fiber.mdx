## What is React Fiber?

**Fiber** is the modern **reconciliation engine** of React (since React 16). It replaces the old recursive stack-based reconciler with a **linked list** of “fibers”—lightweight units of work. Every component gets a fiber node, enabling:

- **Pausing**, **yielding**, and **resuming** rendering
- **Prioritization** of updates (e.g., user input > background fetch)
- **Incremental (time-sliced)** rendering across frames
- Support for **Concurrent Mode**, **Suspense**, **Transitions**, **Error Boundaries**, etc.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Avoid UI jank**: Break large renders into smaller chunks
- **Prioritize tasks**: High-priority updates (like clicks) interrupt low-priority ones
- **Enable concurrency**: Smooth animations and user interaction during renders
- **Resilience**: Enhanced error recovery per component
- **Foundation for modern APIs**: `startTransition`, `Suspense`, `useDeferredValue`, etc.

## Core Architecture

### Fiber Tree

- A **linked list** representation: each fiber has pointers: `.child`, `.sibling`, and `.return` (its “parent”).
- Each fiber represents one component in the tree.

### Fiber Node Properties

- `type`: component or DOM tag
- `pendingProps`, `memoizedProps`: new vs last props
- `memoizedState`: current state (hooks)
- `effectTag`: mark as placement/update/delete
- `alternate`: pointer to previous fiber, enabling reuse
- `priority`: update urgency level

---

## Two-Phase Update Model

1. **Render Phase (diff)**

   - Builds or updates a **work-in-progress fiber tree**
   - Is **interruptible and incremental**—tasks are sliced and paused using `shouldYield()`

2. **Commit Phase**

   - Once work is finished, React flushes changes to the **DOM/UI synchronously**, applying minimal updates and running lifecycle hooks.

---

## What’s New Post-Fiber?

- **React 18+** introduces **Concurrent Mode**, `startTransition()`, and `useDeferredValue`
- **React 19+** adds features like **server components**, **useOptimistic**, **useActionState**, and performance tweaks.

## Simplified Workflow

```plaintext
1. State update -> schedule work with priority
2. React breaks into units (fibers)
3. workLoopConcurrent:
     while (workInProgress && !shouldYield())
       performUnitOfWork(fiber)
4. If paused, wait for next idle frame
5. After finishing, enter commit:
     apply all DOM updates in one go
```

- `performUnitOfWork()` traverses and begins work on each fiber
- `shouldYield()` allows yielding to browser to keep UI responsive ([jser.dev][5])

## Analogy: Chef’s Task List

- **Element tree** = menu order
- **Fiber tree** = detailed prep list
- **Render phase** = kitchen prep (interruptible)
- **Commit phase** = serving dishes (final atomic updates)

---

## Why This Helps You

- Write **responsive UIs**
- Use **Concurrent features** properly (`startTransition`, `Suspense`)
- Know when async rendering helps vs when to avoid complexity
- Debug performance issues by understanding update priority
