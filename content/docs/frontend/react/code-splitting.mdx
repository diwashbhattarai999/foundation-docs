title: Code Splitting
description: Learn how to implement code splitting in React applications to optimize performance by loading only the necessary code for each page.
---

Let's **deep dive into Code Splitting** in React, why it’s important, how it works, and the tools React provides to implement it efficiently — including `React.lazy`, `Suspense`, and dynamic imports.

---

## What is Code Splitting?

**Code Splitting** is a technique to **split your JavaScript bundle** into smaller chunks that can be **loaded on demand**.

### Why?

- Speeds up initial page load
- Reduces the amount of JavaScript parsed/executed initially
- Improves performance especially in large applications

---

## Without Code Splitting

Imagine a single JS file (`bundle.js`) that includes:

- Homepage
- Admin Dashboard
- User Profile
- All components, libraries, utils

Even if the user only visits the homepage, **the entire app** is downloaded & parsed.

---

## With Code Splitting

You break that bundle:

```text
- homepage.chunk.js
- dashboard.chunk.js
- profile.chunk.js
```

Only the **needed code is loaded** when that part of the app is accessed.

---

## How React Supports Code Splitting

### 1. **Dynamic `import()`**

This is a **native JavaScript feature**:

```ts
import("./Dashboard").then((module) => {
  const Dashboard = module.default;
});
```

This splits `Dashboard` into its own JS chunk automatically in tools like **Webpack**, **Vite**, or **Parcel**.

---

### 2. **React.lazy() + Suspense**

React provides a built-in way to lazy load components:

```tsx
import { lazy, Suspense } from "react";

const Dashboard = lazy(() => import("./Dashboard"));

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
        <Dashboard />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- `React.lazy()` **defers loading** the module until it’s needed.
- `Suspense` **renders fallback UI** while the component is being loaded.

> Only supports **default exports**.

---

### 3. **Code Splitting by Routes (Best Practice)**

```tsx
const Home = lazy(() => import("./pages/Home"));
const About = lazy(() => import("./pages/About"));

function Router() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
          <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        </Routes>
      </Suspense>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

Now, Home and About are only loaded **when the user visits them**.

---

## Code Splitting with Vite or Webpack

**Vite** automatically splits code for dynamic imports.

**Webpack** creates separate chunks automatically for each dynamic import.

Optional: You can name your chunks using Webpack magic comments:

```tsx
const Dashboard = lazy(() => import(/* webpackChunkName: "dashboard" */ "./Dashboard"));
```

## Common Pitfalls

| Issue                | Solution                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| No fallback          | Always use `<Suspense fallback={...}>`   |
| Not supported in SSR | Use libraries like `loadable-components` |
| Only default exports | Wrap named exports or re-export          |

---

## Tips for Effective Code Splitting

1. **Split by route** using `React.lazy()` – biggest performance gain.
2. Avoid splitting too deep (e.g., every small component).
3. Lazy load heavy libraries (charts, maps, editors).
4. Use **preload** hints for important routes/components.
5. Cache busting is automatic with most bundlers.
6. Keep fallbacks meaningful (skeleton UI, spinners, placeholders).

---

## Real World Use Case

Lazy load a chart library only when it's needed:

```tsx
const Chart = lazy(() => import("react-chartjs-2"));

function AnalyticsPage() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading Chart...</div>}>
      <Chart />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

| Concept        | Description                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Code Splitting | Load parts of code on demand to improve performance |
| `import()`     | Native way to split code                            |
| `React.lazy()` | Load components lazily                              |
| `Suspense`     | Show fallback during load                           |
| Best usage     | Route-level and heavy third-party components        |
