### What is Lazy Loading?

**Lazy loading** means **deferring the loading of a resource** (component, image, data, etc.) **until it's needed** — improving the **initial load performance** of your app.

> It's a **runtime behavior** that often uses **code splitting** behind the scenes (especially for React components).

---

### Why Lazy Load?

- Reduce **initial bundle size**
- Load heavy or less-critical features only when necessary
- Improve **time to interactive** (TTI) and **core web vitals**

---

### Lazy Loading in React: Components

You’ve already seen this with `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`:

```tsx
const SettingsPanel = React.lazy(() => import("./SettingsPanel"));

<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading Settings...</div>}>
  <SettingsPanel />
</Suspense>;
```

This works thanks to **dynamic imports**:

- `import()` tells your bundler (webpack/Vite) to create a **separate JS chunk**
- It is downloaded **only when rendered**

---

### Lazy Loading Images

React doesn't lazy-load images by default — but browsers support it **natively**:

```html
<img src="/large-image.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Lazy loaded image" />
```

Or with a React wrapper:

```tsx
function LazyImage() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://example.com/heavy.jpg"
      loading="lazy"
      width="600"
      height="400"
      alt="Heavy Image"
    />
  );
}
```

Works in all modern browsers

### Lazy Loading Routes (React Router v6)

React Router + `React.lazy`:

```tsx
const Profile = React.lazy(() => import("./pages/Profile"));

<Route
  path="/profile"
  element={
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading profile...</div>}>
      <Profile />
    </Suspense>
  }
/>;
```

### Lazy Loading vs Code Splitting

| Concept        | What it does                     | Example                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Code Splitting | Breaks bundle into chunks        | `import('./HeavyComponent')`    |
| Lazy Loading   | Loads chunk **when** it's needed | `React.lazy(() => import(...))` |

> Code splitting = pre-bundling strategy
> Lazy loading = run-time loading strategy

---

### Summary

| Feature                      | Supported |
| ---------------------------- | --------- |
| Lazy load React components   | ✅        |
| Lazy load images (native)    | ✅        |
| Route-based lazy loading     | ✅        |
| Custom lazy logic (observer) | ✅        |
| Reduces initial bundle size  | ✅        |

### Best Practices

- Lazy load **non-critical** components (like modals, dashboards, maps, etc.)
- Use **fallbacks** with `<Suspense>` or custom placeholders
- Lazy load **routes and images** for performance
- Combine with **IntersectionObserver** for progressive rendering
