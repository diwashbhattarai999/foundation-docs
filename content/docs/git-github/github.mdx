## What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a cloud-based platform built on top of Git that allows:

- **Remote hosting** of repositories
- **Collaboration** between developers
- **Code reviews**, **issue tracking**, **CI/CD**, **documentation**, and more

> Git manages code **locally**. GitHub allows teams to **collaborate remotely** using Git.

---

## 1. Setting Up a GitHub Account

### Steps:

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
2. Sign up with email and password
3. Set username & verify email
4. Create your first repository (manual or via CLI)

---

## 2. Creating and Connecting a Remote Repository

### On GitHub:

- Click **New repository**
- Add name: `my-portfolio`
- Choose **public/private**
- Don’t initialize with README if pushing local repo

### In Terminal (connect local repo):

```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/my-portfolio.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

`-u` sets upstream so future `git push` works without `origin main`

---

## 3. GitHub Workflow (GitHub Flow)

> This is the recommended way for collaboration.

### GitHub Flow:

```plaintext
main → branch → commit → push → pull request → review → merge → delete branch
```

### Best Practice:

Each feature/fix = 1 branch
Every contribution = Pull Request

---

## 4. Branching & Pull Requests

### Step-by-step:

1. **Create a branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/navbar
   ```

2. **Push it to GitHub**:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/navbar
   ```

3. **Create Pull Request (PR)**:

   - Go to repo on GitHub
   - Click “Compare & pull request”
   - Add title and description
   - Click “Create Pull Request”

4. **Review & Merge**:

   - Use “Files changed” tab
   - Review and comment
   - Merge → Delete branch

---

## 5. Forking & Cloning

### Forking:

Used for **open-source contributions**.

- Click “Fork” button on a public repo
- Make changes in your fork
- Submit **Pull Request** to original repo

### Cloning:

Copy any repo locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
cd repo
```

---

## 6. Issues, Discussions & Projects

### GitHub Issues:

Used for bug tracking, feature requests, and documentation improvements.

- Use labels: `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`
- Use Markdown to format content

### GitHub Discussions:

For long-form Q\&A and community interaction

### GitHub Projects (Kanban):

- Helps manage roadmap
- Columns: `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Done`

---

## 7. Access Management (Private Repos)

- Repo → Settings → Manage access
- Add team members as **Collaborators**
- Assign roles: Admin, Maintainer, Read/Write

---

## 8. GitHub Actions (CI/CD) – Brief Introduction

You can automate:

- Linting
- Testing
- Deployment

Example: Run ESLint on push

```yaml
# .github/workflows/lint.yml
name: Lint Code
on: [push]
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run lint
```
