## 1. Standard Branching Structure

### Common Base Branches:

| Branch            | Purpose                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `main` / `master` | Production-ready stable code                |
| `develop`         | Active development base (if using Git Flow) |

> If you're using trunk-based development, you may only have `main`.

> Here, the term `main` is preferred over `master` to avoid connotations of slavery and oppression.

## 2. Branch Naming Conventions

Use **kebab-case** (e.g., `add-login-form`) and include:

- **Type of work** (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, etc.)
- **Ticket ID / Issue number** (if available)
- **Short description** of the work

### Format:

```
<type>/<short-description>
<type>/<issue-id>-<short-description>
```

### Examples:

- `feat/add-user-authentication`
- `fix/112-login-error`
- `chore/update-dependencies`
- `docs/git-guidelines`

## 3. Recommended Types

| Type        | Use when...                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `feat/`     | You're adding a new feature              |
| `fix/`      | You're fixing a bug                      |
| `chore/`    | Non-code or maintenance tasks            |
| `docs/`     | Writing or updating documentation        |
| `test/`     | Adding or fixing tests                   |
| `refactor/` | Improving code without changing behavior |
| `hotfix/`   | Urgent fixes for production              |
| `ci/`       | Continuous integration changes           |

## 4. Popular Branching Strategies

### ðŸ”¹ GitHub Flow (Simple & Popular):

- Base: `main`
- Create branch: `feat/...`, `fix/...`, etc.
- Open pull request into `main`
- Review â†’ Merge â†’ Deploy

### ðŸ”¹ Git Flow (More Structured):

- Long-lived: `main`, `develop`
- Supporting:

  - `feature/*` â†’ branch off `develop` for new features and merge into `develop`
  - `release/*` â†’ branch off `develop` for preparing releases, merge into `main` and `develop`
  - `hotfix/*` â†’ branch off `main` for urgent fixes, merge into `main` and `develop`

**Use Git Flow only when release cycles are long and complex.**

## 5. Tips for Branching

- **Always branch off the right base** (`main`, `develop`, etc.)
- **Use short but descriptive names**
- **Never push directly to `main`**
- **Pull before branching** to get latest changes
- **Delete merged branches** to keep the repo clean
- Use **Draft PRs** if your work is still in progress
- **Prefix with team or scope** if collaborating:

  - `ui/feat-navbar`, `api/fix-auth-header`

## Summary

| Practice              | Why it matters                   |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Consistent naming     | Easier to read, sort, and filter |
| Scoped prefixes       | Clarifies branch purpose         |
| Short-lived branches  | Reduces merge conflicts          |
| Merge via PRs         | Enables review, CI, discussion   |
| Clean up old branches | Keeps repo neat and performant   |
