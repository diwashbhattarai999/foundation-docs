---

Writing **clear, consistent, and meaningful Git commit messages** is a crucial practice for maintaining a high-quality codebase, especially in team environments. Here's a detailed guide to the **best practices for writing Git commits**, including **why they matter**, **how to write them well**, and **examples**.

---

### 1. Use the **Imperative Mood** in the Subject

Think of the subject as **a command that applies the change**.

✅ Correct:

```
Add login button to navbar
Fix issue with user logout
Refactor authentication middleware
```

❌ Avoid:

```
Added login button to navbar
Fixed bug with logout
Refactored the auth code
```

This aligns with Git's internal commands.

Imagine Git is reading the commit message like a script:

> "If this commit is applied, it will: **Fix login bug**"
> "If this commit is applied, it will: **Add reset password functionality**"

This is why **writing in imperative mood** fits naturally. It describes **what the commit will do when applied**, not what has been done in the past.

---

### 2. Limit the Subject Line

- Keep the **subject line under 50 characters**.
- Use a **capitalized first word**.
- **No period** (`.`) at the end.

✅ Good:

```
Update email regex for validation
```

❌ Avoid:

```
This commit updates the regex for validating emails.
```

---

### 3. Separate the Subject and Body with a Blank Line

Git interprets the first line as the subject and the rest as the body. You must **add a blank line between them** if you include a body.

Example:

```
feat(navbar): add login button

Add a login button to the main navigation bar for easy access.
This improves user experience by allowing quick login.
```

---

### 4. Write a Descriptive Body (Optional but Helpful)

If a commit is not self-explanatory, use the body to describe:

- **What** changed
- **Why** it changed
- **Any trade-offs or implications**

Example:

```
feat(api): add token expiry validation

Token expiry validation was missing in the middleware. This commit ensures
that expired tokens are rejected, and users receive a 401 response. This
improves the app’s overall security.
```

---

### 5. Use Conventional Commit Types for Structure

If you follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), you can use standard types:

| Type       | Purpose                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `feat`     | A new feature                              |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                  |
| `docs`     | Documentation only changes                 |
| `style`    | Changes that don’t affect code behavior    |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `test`     | Adding or fixing tests                     |
| `chore`    | Tooling, build changes, dependencies       |
| `ci`       | CI/CD related changes                      |
| `build`    | Changes to build tools or dependencies     |
| `perf`     | Performance improvements                   |

Example:

```
feat(auth): implement 2FA setup for users
```

---

### 6. Reference Issues/PRs in the Footer

Linking issues helps auto-close them and improve traceability.

Example:

```
fix(auth): prevent session hijacking

We now store session tokens in HttpOnly cookies.

Closes #342
```

---

### 7. Make Atomic Commits

Each commit should be a **single logical change**. Don't mix multiple unrelated changes in one commit.

✅ Better:

```
fix(form): resolve validation error on blur
style(form): improve input spacing
```

❌ Worse:

```
fix: resolve form validation and spacing issues
```

---

## Tools to Help Enforce Good Commits

- **Husky**: Git hooks to run checks before commit/push
- **Commitlint**: Lint commit messages
- **Commitizen**: Interactive commit message tool
- **Semantic Release**: Automatically version your app based on commit messages

---

## Good vs. Bad Examples

### ✅ Good Commit

```
feat(profile): allow users to update profile image

Added a file upload component that saves images to S3.
Users can now change their avatars from the settings page.

Closes #101
```

### ❌ Bad Commit

```
final commit
```

```
update stuff
```

```
added new features and fixed some bugs
```

| Rule                                | Why It Matters                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Use imperative mood                 | Consistent, matches Git style       |
| Keep subject ≤ 50 characters        | Improves readability in logs        |
| Separate subject from body          | Git interprets structure correctly  |
| Explain what/why in body            | Provides context for future readers |
| Use structured types (feat, fix...) | Enables tooling, clarity, SemVer    |
| Reference issues                    | Traceability and automation         |
| One logical change per commit       | Easier to review and revert         |
