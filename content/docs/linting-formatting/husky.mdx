## What is Husky?

**Husky** is a tool that lets you easily manage **Git hooks** in your project. Git hooks are scripts that Git runs **automatically** before or after certain events, such as `commit`, `push`, etc.

### Why Use Husky?

- To **enforce rules** before code is committed or pushed.
- Prevent committing broken code (run linting, tests).
- Automate formatting with tools like Prettier.
- Ensure consistent commit messages (e.g., using **commitlint**).
- Improve code quality and team discipline.

## Git Hooks Basics

Git provides various hooks like:

| Git Hook     | When it runs                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `pre-commit` | Before `git commit` is finalized |
| `commit-msg` | After entering commit message    |
| `pre-push`   | Before pushing code to a remote  |
| `post-merge` | After merging a branch           |

Without Husky, you'd manually place shell scripts in `.git/hooks`, which isn’t easy to version control or maintain.

---

## What Husky Does

- Makes it **easy to define hooks** inside your repo.
- Hook definitions are versioned with your codebase.
- Compatible with **Node scripts**, **shell commands**, etc.

---

## Installing & Using Husky

### Step 1: Install Husky

```bash
npm install husky --save-dev
```

### Step 2: Enable Git Hooks

```bash
npx husky install
```

This creates a `.husky/` directory and sets up Git hooks.

### Step 3: Add `prepare` script to `package.json`

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky install"
  }
}
```

This ensures Husky gets re-installed when someone runs `npm install`.

---

## Adding Hooks

### Example: Add a `pre-commit` hook to run linting

```bash
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm run lint"
```

The above command will:

- Create a `.husky/pre-commit` file
- Add a script inside that file to run `npm run lint`

You can now lint your code **automatically** before every commit!

### Example: Enforce commit message format

```bash
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg 'npx --no -- commitlint --edit "$1"'
```

Combine this with tools like [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to enforce Conventional Commits.

## Common Use Cases

| Hook         | Purpose                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `pre-commit` | Run linter, formatter, type-check, unit tests |
| `commit-msg` | Validate commit message format                |
| `pre-push`   | Run test suite before pushing                 |
| `post-merge` | Auto-install dependencies after branch merge  |

---

## Files Created

When using Husky:

```txt
.husky/
├── pre-commit
├── commit-msg
```

Each file is a shell script that runs your commands.

---

## Best Practices

- Keep hooks fast to avoid slowing down developers.
- Use Husky **with tools like**:

  - ESLint
  - Prettier
  - Commitlint
  - Jest

- Always add `prepare` in `package.json` so it works on CI and in other environments.
