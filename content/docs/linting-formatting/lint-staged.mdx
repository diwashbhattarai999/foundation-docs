description: Use Lint-Staged to run linters on staged files, ensuring code quality before commits.

## What is `lint-staged`?

`lint-staged` is a **command-line utility** that runs **linters or other scripts** on files **that are staged** for a Git commit. This ensures you **only run checks on code you're committing**, not the entire codebase.

### Why use lint-staged?

- Faster than running linters on the whole codebase.
- Ensures you never commit broken or unformatted code.
- Works great with `Husky`'s `pre-commit` hook.
- Automates formatting/linting/testing without affecting unstaged files.

---

## How It Works

1. You make changes to files.
2. You run `git add` to stage files for commit.
3. `lint-staged` runs **only on those staged files** before the commit.
4. If checks pass, the commit continues.
5. If checks fail, the commit is aborted.

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev lint-staged
```

---

## Configuration Options

You can configure `lint-staged` in:

- `package.json`
- `.lintstagedrc` (JSON/YAML)
- `lint-staged.config.js` (recommended for complex setups)

---

### Basic Example in `package.json`

```json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.ts": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"],
    "*.css": ["stylelint --fix"]
  }
}
```

This runs `eslint` and `prettier` on staged `.ts` files and `stylelint` on `.css`.

---

### Using with Husky (`pre-commit`)

1. Install Husky:

```bash
npm install husky --save-dev
npx husky install
```

2. Add prepare script in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky install"
  }
}
```

3. Add pre-commit hook:

```bash
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx lint-staged"
```

Now, every commit will:

- Trigger Huskyâ€™s `pre-commit`
- Run `lint-staged`
- Lint & format only the staged files

## Common Use Cases

| File Type   | Command Example                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| JS/TS files | `"*.ts": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"]` |
| CSS/SCSS    | `"*.{css,scss}": ["stylelint --fix"]`          |
| Markdown    | `"*.md": ["prettier --write"]`                 |
| Tests       | `"*.ts": ["jest --findRelatedTests"]`          |

---

## Things to Keep in Mind

- Only staged files are affected.
- It modifies staged files and re-adds them automatically.
- Make sure tools like ESLint and Prettier are configured correctly.
- Works best with Git and modern JS workflows.
