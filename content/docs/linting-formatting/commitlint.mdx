description: Enforce commit message conventions with CommitLint to maintain a clean and understandable commit history.

## What is `commitlint`?

`commitlint` is a tool that **checks your Git commit messages** against a set of defined rules (usually [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)).

It helps ensure:

- All commit messages follow a consistent format.
- Automated changelogs (with tools like `semantic-release`) work correctly.
- Your Git history remains clean and meaningful.

---

## Installation

Install the required packages:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @commitlint/{config-conventional,cli}
```

---

## Configuration

You need to create a `commitlint.config.js` file in the root of your project:

```js
// commitlint.config.js
module.exports = {
  extends: ["@commitlint/config-conventional"],
};
```

You can also use `.commitlintrc.js` or JSON/YAML formats.

## Add a Git Hook with Husky

To run `commitlint` on every commit:

1. Install Husky (if not already):

```bash
npx husky install
npm pkg set scripts.prepare="husky install"
```

2. Add a commit-msg hook:

```bash
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg 'npx --no -- commitlint --edit "$1"'
```

---

## What Are Conventional Commits?

A conventional commit message has this format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Examples:

```bash
feat(auth): add login with magic link
fix(ui): handle alignment bug in footer
docs(readme): update contributing guide
```

### Bad Examples:

```bash
updated code
bug fixed
final commit
```

## Common Commit Types

| Type       | Use For                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | A new feature                                |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                    |
| `docs`     | Documentation only changes                   |
| `style`    | Code style (formatting, missing semicolons…) |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes nor adds      |
| `test`     | Adding or fixing tests                       |
| `chore`    | Build process or auxiliary tools             |
| `perf`     | Performance improvements                     |
| `ci`       | Continuous Integration configs/scripts       |

---

## Why Use Imperative Mood?

Using **imperative mood** (e.g., _add_, _fix_, _create_, not _added_, _fixed_, _created_) is a convention because:

- Git messages become consistent with auto-generated messages.
- It reads like a command: “If applied, this commit will \_\_\_”.
- Tools like `semantic-release` and `commitizen` expect this.

✅ Correct: `fix(auth): handle login bug`
❌ Wrong: `fixed login bug in auth`

---

## Custom Rules (Optional)

You can override or add rules:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: ["@commitlint/config-conventional"],
  rules: {
    "type-enum": [2, "always", ["feat", "fix", "docs", "style", "refactor", "test", "chore"]],
    "subject-case": [2, "never", ["sentence-case", "start-case"]],
  },
};
```

---

## Commitlint + Commitizen (Bonus)

Use [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) to **prompt commit messages** interactively.

```bash
npm install --save-dev commitizen
npx commitizen init cz-conventional-changelog --save-dev --save-exact
```

Then commit using:

```bash
npx cz
```

## Summary

| Feature               | Description                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Enforces consistency  | Ensures all commits follow the same format    |
| Useful for changelogs | Integrates with tools like `semantic-release` |
| Works with Husky      | Hook into `commit-msg` easily                 |
| Highly configurable   | Extend or override rules as needed            |
| Supports Commitizen   | Adds an interactive CLI for writing commits   |

---

### Example Workflow Setup

1. Configure ESLint/Prettier
2. Set up Husky with pre-commit and commit-msg hooks
3. Add `lint-staged` for staged files
4. Add `commitlint` for commit message checks
5. (Optional) Add Commitizen for interactive commits
