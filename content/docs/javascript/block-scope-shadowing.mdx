## What is a Block?

A **block** in JavaScript is a piece of code wrapped in `{}` curly braces.

```js
{
  // This is a block
}
```

- Also called a **compound statement**.
- We group multiple statements together in a block so that we can use it where JavaScript expects a single statement.
- Blocks are the reason why the `if`, `for`, and `while` statements can contain multiple lines of code.

### Common uses of blocks:

- **if/else**, **for**, **while**, **function bodies**, etc.

```js
if (true) {
  let x = 10;
  console.log(x); // 10 ✅
}
console.log(x); // ❌ ReferenceError
```

---

## What is Scope?

**Scope** determines where variables and functions are **accessible**.

### Types of Scope in JavaScript:

1. **Global Scope**

   - Accessible **everywhere**.

2. **Function/Local Scope**

   - Variables declared inside a function are scoped to that function.

3. **Block Scope** (ES6+)

   - Variables declared with `let` and `const` inside a block `{}` are only available within that block.

### But `var` is not block-scoped:

```js
{
  var a = 5;
}
console.log(a); // ✅ 5 (accessible outside the block)
```

Compare with `let`:

```js
{
  let b = 10;
}
console.log(b); // ❌ ReferenceError
```

---

## Scope Example Breakdown

```js
let a = 1;

function outer() {
  let b = 2;

  {
    let c = 3;
    console.log(a, b, c); // ✅ 1 2 3
  }

  console.log(c); // ❌ ReferenceError
}
```

- `a` is global
- `b` is function-scoped
- `c` is block-scoped

---

## What is Shadowing?

**Shadowing** occurs when a variable declared in an inner scope **has the same name** as one in an outer scope.

```js
var x = 10;

{
  var x = 20; // This shadows the outer x
  console.log(x); // ✅ 20 (inner x)
}

console.log(x); // ✅ 20 (outer x)
```

```js
let x = 10;

{
  let x = 20; // This shadows the outer x
  console.log(x); // ✅ 20 (inner x)
}

console.log(x); // ✅ 10 (outer x)
```

---

## Illegal Shadowing

You **can’t** shadow a `let` or `const` with a `var` in the same scope:

```js
let x = 10;
{
  var x = 20; // ❌ SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared
}
```

But the reverse is legal:

```js
var y = 10;
{
  let y = 20; // ✅ legal shadowing
}
```

---

## Best Practices

- Prefer **`let` and `const`** over `var` to avoid unexpected scope leaks.
- Avoid variable names that **shadow outer variables** unless intentional.
- Use **consistent naming** to avoid confusion in nested scopes.

---

## Code Practice

```js
let message = "Global";

function outer() {
  let message = "Outer";

  {
    let message = "Block";
    console.log(message); // ?
  }

  console.log(message); // ?
}

outer();
console.log(message); // ?
```

### Expected Output:

```
Block
Outer
Global
```

| Concept       | Meaning                                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Block         | Code wrapped inside `{}`                             |
| Scope         | Access level of variables/functions                  |
| Lexical Scope | Scope is determined at code-writing time             |
| Shadowing     | Inner variable hides an outer one with the same name |
