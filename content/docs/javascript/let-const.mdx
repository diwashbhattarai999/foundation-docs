## `let` and `const` – Block Scoped Declarations

### `let`

- Introduced in ES6 (2015).
- Block-scoped (`{}`).
- Can be reassigned.
- **Not hoisted** like `var` (technically hoisted but uninitialized).

```js
let count = 5;
count = 10; // ✅ valid
```

---

### `const`

- Block-scoped (`{}`).
- Must be **initialized during declaration**.
- Cannot be reassigned (though objects/arrays it references _can_ be mutated).

```js
const PI = 3.14;
// PI = 3.1415; ❌ TypeError

const user = { name: "Diwash" };
user.name = "Bhattarai"; // ✅ allowed (mutation, not reassignment)
```

---

## Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

The **Temporal Dead Zone** is the period between entering a block and the variable being declared. During this time, the variable is **hoisted** but **not initialized**, leading to a **ReferenceError** if accessed.

### Example:

```js
console.log(x); // ❌ ReferenceError
let x = 10;
```

- `x` is **hoisted**, but **not initialized** — it’s in the **TDZ**.
- Accessing it before initialization causes a **ReferenceError**.

Same with `const`:

```js
{
  console.log(msg); // ❌ ReferenceError
  const msg = "Hello";
}
```

---

### TDZ Timeline

```txt
Entering block →
  TDZ starts →
    Variable declared (still in TDZ) →
      Variable initialized →
        Now safe to use ✅
```

## JavaScript Error Types

JavaScript provides specific error types to help debug code. Here's how they differ:

---

### 1. SyntaxError

- Happens when the code structure/grammar is invalid.
- Caught during **parsing**, before execution begins.

```js
if (true {
  console.log("Missing bracket");
}
// ❌ SyntaxError: Unexpected token '{'
```

- Also occurs if you use `let` or `const` in invalid places:

```js
const; // ❌ SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
```

- Redeclaring a variable with `let` or `const` in the same scope:

```js
let x = 5;
let x = 10; // ❌ SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared
```

---

### 2. TypeError

- Happens when a **value is not the expected type**.
- Often occurs during execution.

```js
const x = undefined;
x(); // ❌ TypeError: x is not a function

null.foo; // ❌ TypeError: Cannot read property 'foo' of null
```

---

### 3. ReferenceError

- Occurs when referencing a **non-existent or uninitialized variable**.

```js
console.log(a); // ❌ ReferenceError: a is not defined

console.log(x); // ❌ ReferenceError due to TDZ
let x = 5;
```

## Quick Comparison

| Error Type         | When It Occurs                   | Example                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **SyntaxError**    | During parsing (code is invalid) | Missing `)` or `{`                 |
| **TypeError**      | Wrong operation on a value type  | Calling a number as a function     |
| **ReferenceError** | Variable doesn’t exist or TDZ    | Accessing variable before declared |

---

## Best Practices

- Always **declare variables at the top** of the block to avoid TDZ issues.
- Use `const` by default — switch to `let` only if reassignment is required.
- Avoid `var` — it’s function-scoped and hoisted to `undefined`.
- Understand and catch errors early using tools like **ESLint** or TypeScript.

### Summary

| Feature       | `let`               | `const`         |
| ------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| Reassignable  | ✅ Yes              | ❌ No           |
| Block-scoped  | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes          |
| Hoisted       | ✅ (but in TDZ)     | ✅ (but in TDZ) |
| Default usage | For changing values | For constants   |
