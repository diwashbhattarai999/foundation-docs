## JavaScript Overview

JavaScript is:

- **Single-threaded** – it executes one command at a time.
- **Synchronous by default**, but supports asynchronous operations via:
  - `setTimeout`, `Promises`, `async/await`
- **Interpreted and compiled** – modern JS engines like V8 use **JIT (Just-in-Time) compilation** for speed.
- Runs inside a **JavaScript Engine** such as:
  - Chrome → V8
  - Firefox → SpiderMonkey
  - Safari → JavaScriptCore
  - Node.js → V8
- **Event-driven** – responds to user actions, timers, etc.

## What is an Execution Context?

An **Execution Context (EC)** is the **environment** where JavaScript code is evaluated and executed.

You can think of it as a **box** that contains everything JS needs to run a piece of code: variables, functions, and the value of `this`.

> Every time a JS program runs, or a function is called, a new Execution Context is created.

---

## Types of Execution Contexts

1. **Global Execution Context (GEC)**

   - Created when your JS file is first run.
   - Creates a global object:

     - In browser: `window`
     - In Node.js: `global`

   - `this` refers to the global object.
   - Only **one** global context per program.

2. **Function Execution Context (FEC)**

   - Created whenever a function is invoked.
   - Each function gets its own execution context.
   - It has its own scope, variables, and `this` binding.

3. **Eval Execution Context** (rare, using `eval()` function)

   - Not recommended for security/performance reasons.

## What Happens Inside an Execution Context?

When an Execution Context is created, it goes through two main phases: **Creation Phase** and **Execution Phase**.

### 1. Creation Phase (a.k.a. Memory Allocation Phase)

- JS **allocates memory** for:
  - Variables (initialized with `undefined` if declared with `var`)
  - Function declarations (stored entirely)
  - Sets up scope and the `this` value

> `let` and `const` are also hoisted but **not initialized** — they live in the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** until declared.

**Important detail**:

- Variables declared with `var` are **hoisted** and initialized with `undefined`.
- Functions are **hoisted** with their definition.
- `let` and `const` are hoisted too, but are not initialized (in a _temporal dead zone_ until assigned).

### 2. **Execution Phase**

- JS code is executed **line by line**.
- Variables are assigned real values.
- Functions are invoked and new execution contexts are created.

---

## The **Call Stack**

The **Call Stack** is a data structure that tracks **which function is currently being run**, and what should happen after it finishes.

- Think of it like a stack of books — the last one added is the first to be removed (**LIFO: Last In, First Out**).

Example:

```js
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

function main() {
  greet();
}

main();
```

Call Stack:

1. Global Execution Context is created.
2. `main()` is called → `main` Execution Context pushed.
3. Inside `main`, `greet()` is called → `greet` Execution Context pushed.
4. After `greet()` finishes → its context is popped.
5. Then `main()` finishes → its context is popped.

---

### Visualization

```
Call Stack:
| greet EC       |
| main EC        |
| Global EC      |
```

- Call stack maintains the order of execution of
  execution contexts.

- Call Stack is also called :
  - Execution Context Stack
  - Program Stack
  - Control Stack
  - Runtime Stack
  - Machine Stack

When a function finishes, it's removed from the stack.

---

### What Happens on Stack Overflow?

If a function keeps calling itself **without an exit**, it keeps stacking up until memory is full:

```js
function crash() {
  crash();
}

crash(); // ❌ RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
```

This error means the call stack grew too large and JS stopped it to avoid crashing the system.

---

### Summary

- JavaScript runs in an **Execution Context**, starting with Global.
- Each function call creates a new **Function Execution Context**.
- The **Call Stack** keeps track of what function is running.
- Each EC goes through **Creation Phase** and **Execution Phase**.
- Variables & functions are hoisted during creation.
- Too much recursion leads to **stack overflow**.
- The stack operates in a **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** manner.
