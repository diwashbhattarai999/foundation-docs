title: Hoisting
---

## What is **Hoisting** ?

**Hoisting** is JavaScript’s behavior of **moving declarations to the top** of their scope (before code execution).
It is a phenomena by which we can access the variables and functions before they are declared in the code.

It applies to:

- **Variable declarations** (`var`, `let`, `const`)
- **Function declarations**
- **Class declarations** (partially)

But — **only declarations are hoisted, not initializations.**

---

### Example 1 — `var` Hoisting

```js
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;
```

> JavaScript reads this as:

```js
var a;
console.log(a); // undefined
a = 10;
```

---

### Example 2 — `let` and `const` (Temporal Dead Zone)

```js
console.log(b); // ❌ ReferenceError
let b = 20;
```

> `let` and `const` are **hoisted**, but they’re in a **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** — the time between hoisting and actual declaration.

So:

- `var` → hoisted and initialized to `undefined`
- `let`/`const` → hoisted but not initialized (TDZ until line of declaration)

---

### Key Difference:

| Feature       | `var`               | `let` / `const`   |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Hoisted?      | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes            |
| Initialized?  | ✅ With `undefined` | ❌ No (TDZ error) |
| Redeclarable? | ✅ Yes              | ❌ No             |
| Block Scoped? | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes            |

---

### Example 3 — Function Hoisting

```js
greet(); // ✅ Works fine

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

> Full function declarations are hoisted **with their body**.

But **function expressions and arrow functions are not**:

```js
sayHi(); // ❌ TypeError: sayHi is not a function

var sayHi = function () {
  console.log("Hi!");
};
```

```js
hello(); // ❌ TypeError: hello is not a function

const hello = () => {
  console.log("Hi from arrow function");
};
```

### Function vs. Variable Hoisting: Which Wins?

When both a variable and a function share the same name within a scope, **function declarations are hoisted before variable declarations**. However, after hoisting, if a `var` variable shares the same name, it will overwrite the function reference with its value (or `undefined` if not yet assigned).

**Example:**

```js
function demo() {
  var hoisted = "I am a variable";
  function hoisted() {
    return "I am a function";
  }
  return hoisted();
}

console.log(demo()); // TypeError: hoisted is not a function
```

**What happens here?**

1. **During hoisting:**

   - The function declaration `function hoisted() { ... }` is hoisted first.
   - The variable declaration `var hoisted` is also hoisted, but only the declaration (not the assignment).

2. **After hoisting, the code looks like:**

   ```js
   function demo() {
     function hoisted() {
       return "I am a function";
     }
     var hoisted; // This overwrites the function reference with undefined
     hoisted = "I am a variable";
     return hoisted();
   }
   ```

3. **Result:**
   - The variable `hoisted` is initially `undefined` (due to `var hoisted;`).
   - When `hoisted = "I am a variable";` runs, it overwrites the function reference.
   - `return hoisted();` tries to call a string as a function, resulting in a `TypeError`.

**Key Takeaway:**

- **Function declarations are hoisted before variables, but `var` declarations with the same name will overwrite the function reference in the local scope.**
- **Avoid using the same name for variables and functions in the same scope to prevent confusing bugs.**

---

### Global Context: Function vs. Variable Hoisting

In the global scope, if a function and a variable share the same name, the function declaration is hoisted and assigned first during the memory creation phase. The `var` declaration is also hoisted, but it does **not** overwrite the function reference at this stage. Only when the variable is assigned a value during execution does it overwrite the function.

**Example:**

```js
function demo() {
  return "I am a function";
}
var demo = "I am a variable";
console.log(typeof demo); // "string"
```

- During hoisting, `demo` is first set to the function.
- When the assignment `demo = "I am a variable"` runs, it overwrites the function.

**Key Point:**

- In the global context, the function wins during hoisting, but the variable assignment (if present) will overwrite the function at runtime.

## Summary Table

| Type                        | Hoisted?      | Initialized?      | Callable Before Declaration? |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `var`                       | ✅ Yes        | ✅ As `undefined` | ✅ But returns `undefined`   |
| `let`                       | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No (TDZ)       | ❌ ReferenceError            |
| `const`                     | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No (TDZ)       | ❌ ReferenceError            |
| Function Declaration        | ✅ Yes        | ✅ With body      | ✅ Works                     |
| Function Expression (`var`) | ✅ var only   | ✅ As `undefined` | ❌ TypeError                 |
| Arrow Function (`const`)    | ✅ const only | ❌ No (TDZ)       | ❌ ReferenceError            |

## Best Practices

- Always **declare variables at the top** of the scope.
- Prefer `let` or `const` over `var` to avoid surprises.
- Never call functions before declaring them unless using function declarations.
- Avoid `var` unless dealing with legacy code.

---

## Summary

- JavaScript **hoists declarations, not initializations**.
- `var` gets hoisted and initialized to `undefined`.
- `let`/`const` are hoisted but **not initialized** (TDZ).
- Function declarations are hoisted with full definition.
- Function expressions are hoisted like `var`, not usable before defined.
