## JavaScript Runtime Environment

- A **JavaScript Runtime Environment** is a platform that allows JavaScript code to run.
- It provides the necessary components for executing JavaScript, including the JavaScript engine, APIs, and other features.

#### Examples of JavaScript Runtime Environments:

- **Web Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.
- **Node.js**: A server-side runtime environment for executing JavaScript outside of a browser.
- **Deno**: A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, built on V8, similar to Node.js but with a focus on security and modern features.

#### Common features of JavaScript Runtime Environments:

- **JavaScript Engine**: The core component that executes JavaScript code.
- **Web APIs**: Browser-provided APIs for tasks like DOM manipulation, AJAX, etc.
- **Event Loop**: Manages asynchronous operations and callbacks.
- **Call Stack**: Keeps track of function calls.
- **Memory Heap**: Where objects and variables are stored.

## Web APIs

- **Web APIs** are interfaces provided by browsers or Node.js that allow JavaScript to interact with the environment.
- They provide functionalities like DOM manipulation, network requests, timers, and more.
- It can be similar in both browsers and Node.js, but there are differences in implementation and available APIs.
- E.g. `setTimeout`, `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, etc.

## What is a JavaScript Engine?

A **JavaScript Engine** is a program that **executes JavaScript code**.

- It is not a physical machine but a software component that interprets and runs JavaScript code, converting it into low-level machine code that the CPU can understand.
- E.g. `V8`, `SpiderMonkey`, `JavaScriptCore`, etc.
- `V8` is written in C/C++.

Every modern browser has its own JS engine:

| Browser         | JavaScript Engine                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Chrome, Node.js | **V8**                                    |
| Firefox         | **SpiderMonkey**                          |
| Safari          | **JavaScriptCore** (a.k.a. Nitro)         |
| Edge            | **Chakra** (before switching to Chromium) |

> The most famous JS engine is **V8**, used in **Google Chrome** and **Node.js**.

> First JS engine was created by Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, and is known as **SpiderMonkey**.

## What Does the JS Engine Do?

The JS engine:

1. **Parses** JavaScript code.
2. **Compiles** it into machine code (using JIT).
3. **Executes** the machine code.
4. Manages **memory** (allocation, garbage collection).
5. Handles **asynchronous operations** with the help of the environment (browser/Node.js).

---

## JS Engine Components (e.g., V8)

### 1. **Parser**

- Converts JS code into tokens
- Creates an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** using Syntax Parser.
- It checks for syntax errors.

```js
let a = 10;
```

→ becomes an AST tree like:

```
VariableDeclaration
  ├─ Identifier: a
  └─ Literal: 10
```

> Visit [AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net/) to visualize ASTs.

---

### 2. **Interpreter** (e.g. `Ignition` in V8)

- Quickly **converts AST to bytecode** (a low-level intermediate representation).
- This bytecode is executed **immediately**, ensuring fast startup.

---

### 3. **Compiler (JIT)** – (e.g. `TurboFan` in V8)

- **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compiler takes the bytecode and **optimizes** frequently used code paths into **machine code**.
- Optimization is **based on runtime behavior** (hot functions).

> Hot functions = frequently executed functions

---

### 4. **Profiler + Optimizer**

- The profiler watches which functions run most often.
- TurboFan optimizes those using **inline caching**, **type feedback**, and **hidden classes**.

---

### 5. **Garbage Collector**

- Automatically **cleans up memory** by removing objects no longer referenced.
- V8 uses:

  - **Mark-and-sweep**
  - **Generational GC** (splitting memory into new/old spaces)
  - **Incremental GC** (to avoid freezing)

---

## Execution Pipeline in V8

1. JS Source Code
2. Parsed → AST
3. AST → Bytecode (via Interpreter: Ignition)
4. Optimized into Machine Code (via JIT Compiler: TurboFan)
5. Executed on CPU
6. Memory managed via GC

## Optimization Techniques in V8

| Technique             | Description                                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hidden Classes        | Internally assigns shape to objects (like classes in C++) |
| Inline Caching        | Optimizes repeated property access                        |
| Function Inlining     | Embeds the body of a function in caller’s code            |
| Dead Code Elimination | Removes code never executed                               |
| Constant Folding      | Pre-computes constant expressions                         |

## Example

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  add(5, 10); // JIT compiler sees this pattern and optimizes
}
```

- Initially interpreted.
- After several iterations, V8 sees it's a **hot function** and compiles it to optimized machine code.

---

## Garbage Collection in V8

V8 uses two memory spaces:

- **New space** (young generation) – for short-lived objects.
- **Old space** (old generation) – for long-lived objects.

GC Process:

- **Mark** reachable objects
- **Sweep** unreferenced memory
- **Compact** and move live data together to avoid memory fragmentation

## JS Engine vs Runtime

| JavaScript Engine     | JavaScript Runtime                            |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Parses & runs JS code | Provides environment (like DOM, timers, APIs) |
| Example: V8           | Example: Browser (Chrome), Node.js            |
| Pure JS logic         | Adds I/O, file system, etc.                   |

> The engine doesn't handle `setTimeout`, `fetch`, or the DOM — **the runtime does**.

---

## Fun Fact

- `console.log()` is **not part of JavaScript or V8**, but added by the browser (or Node.js) which is the Web API.
- The phrase **"Maximum call stack size exceeded"** is an error caused by recursion in the **Call Stack** managed by the engine.
