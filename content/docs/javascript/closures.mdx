## What is a Closure?

A **closure** is created when a **function remembers** its **lexical scope**, even when that function is executed **outside** of that scope.

### In simple terms:

> A **closure is a function that has access to its outer function's variables**, even after the outer function has finished executing.

---

### Basic Example

```js
function outer() {
  let name = "Diwash";

  function inner() {
    console.log(name); //  Can still access `name`
  }

  return inner;
}

const fn = outer();
fn(); // Logs: Diwash
```

Even though `outer()` has finished executing, the returned function `inner` still **remembers** the variable `name`.

---

## Why Closures Work?

- Because **JavaScript functions are first-class citizens**.
- They **remember** the scope in which they were created, not where they're called.
- **Lexical scope** + **function object** = Closure.

---

## Common Use Cases

### 1. **Data Privacy / Encapsulation**

Closures allow you to "hide" variables from the global scope.

```js
function secretHolder() {
  let secret = "I am Batman";

  return {
    getSecret: () => secret,
    setSecret: (newSecret) => (secret = newSecret),
  };
}

const mySecret = secretHolder();
console.log(mySecret.getSecret()); // I am Batman
mySecret.setSecret("I am Diwash");
console.log(mySecret.getSecret()); // I am Diwash
```

---

### 2. **Function Factories**

Create functions dynamically:

```js
function multiplyBy(n) {
  return function (x) {
    return x * n;
  };
}

const double = multiplyBy(2);
const triple = multiplyBy(3);

console.log(double(5)); // 10
console.log(triple(5)); // 15
```

---

### 3. **setTimeout Inside Loops**

Closures help preserve values in async code:

```js
for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i); // prints 4 three times
  }, i * 1000);
}
```

Fix with closure:

```js
for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  (function (j) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(j), j * 1000);
  })(i);
}
```

Or with `let` (block-scoped):

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), i * 1000);
}
```

---

### 4. **Currying with Closures**

```js
function greet(greeting) {
  return function (name) {
    return `${greeting}, ${name}`;
  };
}

const sayHello = greet("Hello");
console.log(sayHello("Diwash")); // Hello, Diwash
```

---

## Important Things to Remember

- **Closures retain memory** — they keep a reference to their lexical scope.
- **Variables aren't copied**, they are **referenced**.
- Can lead to **memory leaks** if not managed properly.
- Used heavily in **React hooks**, **callbacks**, **event handlers**, **stateful logic**.

---

## Closures and Memory

```js
function counter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function () {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}

const inc = counter();
console.log(inc()); // 1
console.log(inc()); // 2
```

- The `count` variable stays **alive** in memory because it's referenced by the closure.
- Closures **can retain state** across multiple calls.

---

## Closures vs Scope

| Concept       | Description                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Scope         | Area where a variable can be accessed      |
| Closure       | Function + lexical scope it was defined in |
| Lexical Scope | Scope defined during function creation     |

---

## Summary

- Closures occur when **a function accesses variables outside its immediate scope**.
- Closures allow **private state**, **function factories**, **preserved values**, and **async value handling**.
- Be mindful of **memory**, especially in loops, timeouts, and large apps.
