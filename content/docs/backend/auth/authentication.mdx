title: Authentication
---

Authentication systems vary based on how they manage identity state between the client and the server. Below is a comprehensive breakdown from the **ground up**, explaining core concepts and real-world practices with clarity, covering **stateful, stateless, session-based, session-less, JWT-based, and more**:

---

## 1. **Core Concepts of Authentication**

- **Authentication**: Verifying **who the user is**.
- **Authorization**: Verifying **what they are allowed to do**.
- **Session**: A persisted context of identity between multiple requests.
- **Token**: A digitally signed string used to validate identity without storing state server-side.

---

## 2. **Stateful Authentication (Session-based)**

### Definition:

Server **stores user session data** (like a session ID) after login. The client only holds a reference (usually a cookie with session ID).

### Flow:

1. User logs in.
2. Server generates a unique session ID.
3. Server stores session info in memory, Redis, or DB.
4. Session ID is sent to client (typically in a cookie).
5. Client sends it on every request.
6. Server checks session store to verify identity.

### State:

- **State is kept on the server** (session store).

### Pros:

- Easy to revoke sessions.
- Central control (can destroy session anytime).
- Secure when combined with HTTPS and `HttpOnly` cookies.

### Cons:

- Not scalable across multiple servers unless session store is centralized (e.g., Redis).
- Extra DB or cache lookup per request.

### Use case:

- Admin dashboards, secure backends, traditional web apps.

## 3. **Stateless Authentication (Token-based)**

### Definition:

All necessary information to verify a user is stored in a **token** (like JWT), and **no session is kept on server**.

### Flow:

1. User logs in.
2. Server generates a **JWT** containing user info and signs it.
3. JWT is returned to client (stored in localStorage or cookie).
4. Client sends JWT in **Authorization header** on every request.
5. Server verifies JWT signature and extracts user info.

### State:

- **No state is stored on server** after token generation.

### Pros:

- Fully scalable (no server-side storage).
- Faster (no DB lookup needed).
- Easy integration with mobile apps, microservices.

### Cons:

- Token revocation is **hard** without additional state.
- If token is stolen, attacker has full access until it expires.
- Must handle **token expiration** and **refresh tokens** securely.

### Use case:

- REST APIs, SPAs, mobile apps.

---

## 4. **Session-based Authentication (Stateful via Cookies)**

This is a subset of **stateful auth** where:

- Sessions are stored server-side.
- **Cookies** (typically with session ID) are used to maintain state between client and server.

Best practice:

- Use `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=strict/lax` flags.
- Store cookie in browser, not in JS-accessible storage.

---

## 5. **Session-less Authentication (Token-based, typically JWT)**

This is another name for **stateless** authentication:

- No session is stored on server.
- All info is in token (usually JWT).
- Auth state is stored on client side.

---

## 6. **JWT (JSON Web Token)**

### Structure:

```
Header.Payload.Signature
```

Example:

```json
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEyMywiZW1haWwiOiJ0ZXN0QGV4LmNvbSJ9.VVFTXZ8qYzQd
```

### Signed:

- With secret key (`HS256`) or private/public key (`RS256`).

### Flow:

- On login, server returns a JWT.
- JWT is stored on client (localStorage/cookie).
- Client sends JWT on every request in `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Server verifies signature and reads the claims.

### Refresh Flow (Best Practice):

- Short-lived **access token** (5–15 minutes).
- Long-lived **refresh token** stored securely (cookie or secure store).
- Use refresh token to get a new access token without relogging.

### Pros:

- Scalable.
- Self-contained.

### Cons:

- No built-in revocation.
- Leaked tokens = serious damage.
- Refresh token handling adds complexity.

## 7. OAuth 2.0 (Token-based with 3rd party identity)

Often used with Google, Facebook, GitHub login.

### Flow:

1. User logs in via provider.
2. Provider redirects with **auth code**.
3. Server exchanges code for **access token**.
4. Server uses access token to retrieve user info.

### Usually combined with:

- JWT tokens for downstream systems.
- Stateless token auth.

## Summary Table

| Method           | Server Stores State? | Token-based? | Revoke Easily?         | Scalability | Best For                               |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Session (cookie) | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ Limited  | Web apps, secure portals               |
| Stateless (JWT)  | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No (unless managed) | ✅ Yes      | APIs, mobile, microservices            |
| Session-less     | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes (JWT) | ❌ No                  | ✅ Yes      | SPAs, decentralized systems            |
| OAuth 2.0        | ❌ No (mostly)       | ✅ Yes       | ❌ Complex             | ✅ Yes      | 3rd-party auth (Google, Facebook, etc) |

## Industry Best Practices

- **Always use HTTPS** for any auth system.
- **Secure cookies**: `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`.
- Use **short-lived tokens** with **refresh mechanism**.
- Never store JWT in localStorage (XSS risk).
- Use Redis or similar for **blacklisting revoked tokens** (if using JWT).
- Understand trade-offs between **ease of scaling** vs **security control**.
