# Summery on middleware and Helmet middleware

**Middleware** functions in Express.js are functions that have access to the `req` (request), `res` (response), and `next()` middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle.

## They are used to (common uses)

- modify request/response objects
- execute code(e.g logging,authentication)
- End the request-response cycle
- call the next middleware in the stack

## Example of common middleware

- built-in: express.json(),express.static()
- third-party: helmet,cors

# Helmet package (third party package for security )

**Helmet is a popular third-party middleware for Express.js that helps secure web apps by setting various HTTP headers. It protects against common vulnerabilities like:**

- cross-site scripting(xss)
- clickjacking
- MIME type sniffing
- insecure downloads

## Example

```ts
import express from 'express';
import helmet from 'helmet';

const app = express();
app.use(helmet()); // Enables default security headers
```

## Conclusion

**_Middleware is the foundation of request handling in Express.js. The helmet package is a specialized middleware that boosts your app’s security with minimal setup by setting protective HTTP headers._**
