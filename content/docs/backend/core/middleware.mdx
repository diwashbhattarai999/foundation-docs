# Middleware System in Express (with TypeScript)

## What is Middleware?

Middleware is a **function** that has access to the request and response lifecycle and can:

- Modify the `req` or `res`
- End the request-response cycle
- Pass control to the next middleware using `next()`

```ts
(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => void
```

---

## Middleware Execution Flow

Middlewares are **executed in order** — top-down.

```ts
app.use(middleware1);
app.use(middleware2);
app.get("/route", middleware3, controllerHandler);
```

If one of them doesn't call `next()`, the flow **stops there**.

## Types of Middleware

| Type              | Use Case                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Global middleware | Logging, CORS, body parser, security |
| Route-specific    | Auth checks, input validation        |
| Error-handling    | Centralized error response           |
| Custom reusable   | Rate limiter, IP filter, request ID  |

---

## Recommended Folder Structure

```
src/
├── middlewares/
│   ├── auth.middleware.ts
│   ├── logger.middleware.ts
│   └── rateLimit.middleware.ts
```

---

## Setting Up a Middleware (Example: Logger)

```ts
// src/middlewares/logger.middleware.ts
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from "express";

export const loggerMiddleware = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  console.log(`[${req.method}] ${req.originalUrl}`);
  next();
};
```

Usage:

```ts
import express from "express";
import { loggerMiddleware } from "./middlewares/logger.middleware";

const app = express();
app.use(loggerMiddleware);
```

---

## Route-Specific Middleware

```ts
app.get("/admin", isAdminMiddleware, adminController);
```

---

## Error-Handling Middleware

Special format with **4 args**:

```ts
(err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => void
```

---

## Middleware Composition Utility

Create a utility to group and reuse middleware chains across your app:

```ts
// src/utils/compose.ts

import { NextFunction, Request, RequestHandler, Response } from "express";

/**
 * Compose multiple middleware functions into a single RequestHandler.
 *
 * @param middlewares - An array of Express middleware functions
 * @returns A single middleware that runs them in sequence
 */
export function compose(...middlewares: RequestHandler[]): RequestHandler {
  return function (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction): void {
    /**
     * Loop through middlewares
     */
    (function run(i: number): void {
      /**
       * Assign middlewares one by one
       * Return next if no middleware is found or end is reached
       */
      const middleware = middlewares[i];
      if (!middleware) return next();

      /**
       * Return error inside next to trigger global error handler
       */
      middleware(req, res, function (err?: any): void {
        if (err) return next(err);
        run(i + 1);
      });
    })(0); // Immediately invoke to start from first middleware
  };
}
```

---

## Common Middleware You Should Implement

| Middleware            | Description                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `loggerMiddleware`    | Logs each request to console or file    |
| `authMiddleware`      | Checks for auth token / session         |
| `rateLimitMiddleware` | Prevents API abuse via IP-based limits  |
| `requestIdMiddleware` | Adds `req.id` to track logs per request |
| `validateMiddleware`  | Validates input using Zod or Joi        |

---

## Best Practices

- Keep middlewares **pure** (no side effects unless intended)
- Always call `next()` unless you’re sending a response
- Group middleware into separate files
- Reuse custom middlewares across services (e.g., auth)
