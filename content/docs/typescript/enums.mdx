## What is an Enum?

An **enum** (short for _enumerations_) is a way to define a **set of named constants**. It’s useful when you want to represent a fixed number of related values with readable names.

---

## Basic Syntax

```ts
enum Direction {
  Up,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}
```

By default, enum members are assigned values starting from `0`.

```ts
Direction.Up; // 0
Direction.Down; // 1
```

You can also assign **custom values**:

```ts
enum StatusCode {
  OK = 200,
  BadRequest = 400,
  Unauthorized = 401,
  NotFound = 404,
}
```

---

## Reverse Mapping (Only for Numeric Enums)

```ts
enum Color {
  Red = 1,
  Green,
  Blue,
}

console.log(Color.Red); // 1
console.log(Color[2]); // Green
```

---

## String Enums (Recommended for Readability)

```ts
enum Role {
  Admin = "ADMIN",
  Doctor = "DOCTOR",
  Patient = "PATIENT",
}
```

Safer and clearer for logs, debugging, and APIs.

---

## Example: Using Enums in Functions

```ts
enum LogLevel {
  Info = "INFO",
  Warning = "WARNING",
  Error = "ERROR",
}

function log(message: string, level: LogLevel): void {
  console.log(`[${level}] ${message}`);
}

log("Server started", LogLevel.Info);
log("Low disk space", LogLevel.Warning);
log("Service crashed", LogLevel.Error);
```

---

## Const Enums (Compile-Time Optimization)

```ts
const enum Size {
  Small,
  Medium,
  Large,
}

let mySize: Size = Size.Medium;
```

> `const enum` gets inlined during compilation. No runtime object is generated. Must be used cautiously.

---

## Use Cases

- API status codes
- Roles & permissions
- Log levels
- Config states (e.g., ThemeMode.Light/Dark)

---

## Best Practices

- Prefer **string enums** or **union types** for clarity and safety.
- Avoid **heterogeneous enums**.
- Use **const enums** only when you want **zero runtime cost** and know the values will never change.

## Task 4 – Practice

In a file `enums.ts`:

1. Define a `ThemeMode` enum: `"LIGHT" | "DARK"`.
2. Create a function `applyTheme(mode: ThemeMode)` that logs the mode.
3. Create a `UserRole` enum: `Admin`, `Editor`, `Viewer`, and log their values.
