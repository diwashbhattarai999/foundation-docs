description: Learn about package managers in JavaScript/Node.js, how they work, and why

## What is a Package Manager?

A **package manager** is a tool that automates:

- **Installing** software packages (like libraries/frameworks)
- **Managing dependencies** (other packages required by your project)
- **Version control** (ensuring specific versions are used)
- **Updating** packages to newer versions

In JavaScript (Node.js), the most popular package managers are:

| Package Manager | Description                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm`           | Node Package Manager (official)                   |
| `yarn`          | Developed by Facebook (performance + security)    |
| `pnpm`          | Fast and disk-efficient alternative               |
| `bun`           | Newer, fast runtime with built-in package manager |

## What is a "Package"?

A **package** is a folder with:

- Code (usually JavaScript or TypeScript)
- A `package.json` file containing metadata like name, version, dependencies

For example:

```json
{
  "name": "express",
  "version": "4.18.2",
  "dependencies": { ... }
}
```

---

## What is `package.json`?

This is the **manifest** of your project. It defines:

- Project metadata (`name`, `version`, `description`)
- Scripts (e.g., `start`, `build`, `test`)
- Dependencies (libraries your code needs)
- Dev dependencies (tools needed only during development)
- Peer dependencies (packages that your package expects to be installed by the consumer)
- Author (name, email, url, etc.)
- License (e.g., MIT, Apache, etc.)
- Repository (where the code is hosted, e.g., GitHub)
- Keywords (tags to help discover the package)
- Engines (Node.js version compatibility)
- type (`module` or `commonjs` for module system)
- private (if true, prevents accidental publishing)

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "my-api",
  "description": "A simple API built with Express",
  "main": "src/server.js",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "private": true,
  "author": "Your Name <your.email@example.com>",
  "license": "MIT",
  "keywords": ["api", "express", "node"],
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/my-api.git"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/server.js",
    "dev": "nodemon src/server.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.0.0"
  },

  "engines": {
    "node": ">=20.0.0",
    "pnpm": ">=10.0.0"
  }
}
```

## What is `node_modules`?

After you run `npm install`, all the packages your app needs are downloaded into a `node_modules/` folder. This is where the actual code of your libraries lives.

Each module can also have its own dependencies inside.

## Common Commands

### npm (default in Node.js)

| Command                | Description                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `npm init -y`          | Generate `package.json` with default values  |
| `npm install <pkg>`    | Install a package                            |
| `npm install`          | Install all dependencies from `package.json` |
| `npm install -D <pkg>` | Install as dev dependency                    |
| `npm uninstall <pkg>`  | Remove a package                             |
| `npm update`           | Update all packages to latest versions       |
| `npm outdated`         | Show outdated packages                       |
| `npm run <script>`     | Run a script from `package.json`             |

### yarn (alternative)

```bash
yarn init -y
yarn add express
yarn remove express
yarn upgrade
```

### pnpm (faster, disk-saving alternative)

```bash
pnpm init
pnpm add express
pnpm remove express
```

## Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

Package versions follow: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

For example: `1.3.2`

- `^1.3.2` = any compatible version up to `2.0.0` (recommended)
- `~1.3.2` = patch updates only (up to `1.3.x`)
- `1.3.2` = fixed version

---

## How Does It Work Internally?

1. You run `npm install express`
2. npm:

   - Downloads the latest compatible version from the **npm registry**
   - Caches it locally
   - Adds it to `node_modules`
   - Updates `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

> **npm Registry:** A large public database of packages ([https://registry.npmjs.org/](https://registry.npmjs.org/))

---

## What is `package-lock.json`?

It records the **exact version** of every installed dependency to:

- Ensure consistent installs across machines
- Speed up installs (itâ€™s a cache)

---

## Global vs Local Packages

| Type   | Installed Using        | Example                                          |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Local  | `npm install <pkg>`    | `express`, `axios`, etc.                         |
| Global | `npm install -g <pkg>` | CLI tools like `nodemon`, `typescript`, `eslint` |
