description: Learn how to use NVM (Node Version Manager) and configuration files like `.nvmrc` and `.npmrc` to manage Node.js versions and NPM settings effectively.
---

## `.npmrc` – NPM Configuration File

### What is it?

`.npmrc` is a config file for **NPM (Node Package Manager)**. It lets you configure **how npm behaves** on a per-project or global basis.

### Locations

- `~/.npmrc` → **Global** config (affects all projects)
- `<project>/.npmrc` → **Project-level** config (local to repo)

### Common Settings

| Setting                 | Description                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `save-exact=true`       | Save exact versions (`1.2.3` instead of `^1.2.3`)       |
| `registry=https://...`  | Use a custom package registry (e.g., private or GitHub) |
| `strict-ssl=false`      | Allow insecure SSL (not recommended)                    |
| `legacy-peer-deps=true` | Avoid peer dep conflict errors (especially in npm v7+)  |
| `package-lock=false`    | Avoid generating lock files (not recommended)           |
| `always-auth=true`      | Always send credentials when accessing registry         |

### Example `.npmrc`

```ini
save-exact=true
legacy-peer-deps=true
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

## `.nvmrc` – Node Version Manager Config

### What is it?

`.nvmrc` is a simple file used with **NVM (Node Version Manager)** that specifies the **Node.js version** to use for the project.

### Purpose

Ensure everyone on the team (and CI/CD) uses the **same Node version**.

### Example

```
18.17.1
```

or use `lts/*`, `node`, `v16`, etc.

Here’s a complete guide for installing **NVM (Node Version Manager)** on **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**, covering everything from basic installation to verification.

---

## What is NVM?

**NVM** is a version manager for Node.js. It lets you **install and switch between multiple versions of Node.js easily**.

---

## Installing NVM on Linux/macOS (Unix-like systems)

> Recommended if you're using Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch, macOS, WSL, etc.

### Step 1: Install NVM via curl or wget

```bash
# With curl
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash

# OR with wget
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

> This script will:
>
> - Clone the `nvm` repo to `~/.nvm`
> - Add the necessary lines to your shell config (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile`)

### Step 2: Activate NVM

After installation, restart the terminal or run:

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

Add that snippet to your shell file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) to persist it.

---

### Step 3: Verify Installation

```bash
nvm --version
```

---

## Installing NVM on Windows

On Windows, the **official `nvm` doesn't work** directly. Use the **community-maintained version**:

### Step 1: Download `nvm-windows`

- Go to: [https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)
- Download the latest `.exe` (e.g., `nvm-setup.exe`)

### Step 2: Run the Installer

- Follow the setup wizard.
- Choose an install directory (default is fine).
- It will automatically update your PATH.

### Step 3: Verify Installation

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell:

```bash
nvm version
```

---

## Installing Node.js using NVM

Once NVM is installed:

```bash
nvm install 18.17.1        # Installs a specific Node version
nvm use 18.17.1            # Switches to that version
nvm alias default 18.17.1  # Sets it as default for new terminals
```

---

## Tips: Create `.nvmrc` File

Inside your project root:

```bash
echo "18.17.1" > .nvmrc
```

Then just run:

```bash
nvm use
```

It’ll read the version from `.nvmrc` and switch automatically.

### Usage

```bash
nvm use         # Reads version from .nvmrc
nvm install     # Installs version defined in .nvmrc
```

### Best Practice

- Always commit `.nvmrc` to version control.
- Sync with your CI tool and Dockerfile (if any).
